# Navigation Developer challenge

This repo utilizes the rollup-starter-app boilerplate repository for bundling and deploying the application to a Node server. See below for commands to run the application.

This application creates a simple navigation bar using Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML and will display the timezone for the selected city below the nav

This repo contains a bare-bones example of how to create an application using Rollup, including importing a module from `node_modules` and converting it from CommonJS.

## Getting started

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
